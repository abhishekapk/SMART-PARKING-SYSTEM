<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p align="justify">Computerized systems being an integral part of the current era, an automated parking system is one of its most commonly used applications.  The aim of this model is to build up and implement an automatic parking system that will detect the parking space with the help of image processing technique of the parking lot as well as reduce the human power. The smart parking system will able to have fewer interaction of humans. In additions to that, it has parking guidance system that can demonstrate and guide user towards a parking space. With the problems of ever increasing urban traffic congestion and the ever increasing shortage of space, the parking lots need to be well-equipped with parking space detection. The proposed system helps in counting the number of parked vehicles and, identifying the number of spots available. The system detects cars through images instead of electronic sensors embedded on the floors. A camera is installed at a high and fixed position in the parking lot. An image of empty parking lot is taken as reference and then image of parking lot with cars is taken. Both the images are subtracted to find the numbers of parking slots available.

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
 <p align="justify">Nowadays, car has become a necessity; it is no more a luxury especially for the working people. People even purchase car on installments. When talking about metropolitan, then traffic jams have become quite common recently during large number of vehicles. Also, we cannot deny the existence of the cars in our daily life. Whenever we go out by car, we face problems to find an available parking space.  When driver enters a certain parking lot, the first thing that he does is to look for some sign which tells whether the parking lot is fully occupied, partly occupied or vacant. . He also does not know how many parking slots are there and where to find a parking division for his car. Some of the parking divisions may remain unoccupied even when the total occupancy is high. This causes ineffective use of parking divisions as well as traffics jams around the entrance of parking lot. Therefore, by offering drivers with relevant information about the parking lot while entering the parking lot becomes an important issue.  When driver enters a certain parking lot, the driver takes a long time just to find an available parking space. Counting Available Parking Space using Image Processing helps to solve the problem that the driver faces at low cost. The system uses image processing to detect the existence of the car and also provides information such as number of available parking space. The system captures image using CCTV cameras and processes the image to count the available parking space. The system basically is implement  to plan, analyze, design, development and testing. The development of this system will use techniques of image processing that will be implemented in each phase of the methodology. This system gives information about the number of available parking space. It will provide benefit to all the drivers when they enter the parking lot. The system uses image processing, since the whole area in the parking lot can be observed with relatively few cameras. Other than that, the system is compact and the cost is not high. The image of a parking lot is taken by a surveillance camera set at some height in the parking lot.  MATLAB is used as software platform in this project.
